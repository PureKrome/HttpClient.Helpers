Code that uses `System.Net.Http.HttpClient` will attempt to actually call/hit that Http endpoint.

To prevent this from happening in a *unit* test, some simple helpers are provided in this code library.

## Key Points
- Use Dependency Injection to hijack your request (this library makes it _supa dupa easy_ to do this)
- Works with GET/POST/etc.
- Can provide wildcards (i.e. I don't care about the Request endpoint or the request HTTP Method, etc)
- Can provide multiple endpoints and see handle what is returned based on the particular request.
- Can be used to test network errors during transmission. i.e. can test when the HttpClient throws an exception because of .. well ... :boom:

Special Ackowledgements

A special and sincere *thank you* to David Fowler ([@davidfowl](http://www.twitter.com/davidfowl)) who explained how I should be unit testing the `HttpClient` class and gave me the guidence to make this library. I was soooo on the wrong path - and he guided me back on track.

Thank you David! :ok_hand: :cocktail: :space_invader:

###Summary

Finally, unit testing `HttpClient` is now awesome and simple!
